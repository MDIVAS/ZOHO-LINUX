## About The Project

THIS LINUX IS BASED ON ARCH LINUX ON HYPERLAND SESSION

THIS LINUX IS OPTIMISED TO RUN ALL THE ZOHO APPS

IT CONTAINS ALL THE ZOHO APPS AND RUNS WITHOUT ERROR

THIS LINUX HAS INBUILT TOOLS THAT CAN CONVERT DEBIAN AND REDHAT PACKAGE TO TARZ AND RUN IT 


THIS LINUX USES LESS RAM AND CPU THAN WINDOWS 

THIS LINUX HAS GOOD UI AND ANIMATIONS 

THE DRIVERS COME PRE INSTALLED ON IT 

THE ZOHO APPS ARE RUNNING ON AN ANDROID ENVIRONMENT 
AND ALSO ARE VERY SECURE 




## Built With

THE LINUX IS MAINLY BUILT USING ARCHLINUX BUT WITH HYPRLAND SESSION 

* [ARCHLINUX ](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Hyprland)
* []()

## Getting Started

TO INSTALL ZOHO-LINUX IT REQUIRES A LOT OF KNOWLEDGE BECAUSE UNLIKE WINDOWS SETUP U HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING MANUALLY 

### Prerequisites

1)PENDRIVE
2)ARCHLINUX ISO
3)TIME
4)VIM AND NANO TOOLS
5)BCD EDIT

### Installation

1) TO INSTALL ZOHO-LINUX U NEED PURE KNOWLEDGE ON LINUX 

2)FLASH THE PENDRIVE WITH LINUX ISO

3)BOOT THE PENDRIVE 

4)FOLLOW THE TUTORIAL AT ARCH PAGE AND INSTALL IT 

5)ARCHLINUX IS A FREE OPENSOURCE 


## Usage

IT CAN BE USED TO CREATE MORE LINUX TO USE MORE FEATURES


## Roadmap
